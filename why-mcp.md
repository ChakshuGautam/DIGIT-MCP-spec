# Why MCP for DIGIT Platform?

## The Problem
DIGIT platform: 20+ microservices, multiple stakeholders, different technical depths.
Everyone struggles with visibility, debugging, and operations.

## The Spectrum

### 🛠️ Contributors (Core Engineers)
**Do:** Build services, debug transactions, implement features
**Need:** Trace requests, understand dependencies, debug production

### 🚀 Accelerators (Solution Implementers)  
**Do:** Deploy for governments, configure workflows, monitor production
**Need:** Health checks, diagnose configs, troubleshoot without code access

### 🔧 The Middle
DevOps, Architects, Support, QA - each needs different access levels

## Current Pain

**Contributors:**
- Tracing across 20+ services
- Complex local setups
