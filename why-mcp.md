# Why MCP for DIGIT Platform?

## The Problem
DIGIT platform: 20+ microservices, multiple stakeholders, different technical depths.
Everyone struggles with visibility, debugging, and operations.

---

## The Spectrum

### 🛠️ Contributors (Core Engineers)
**Do:** Build services, debug transactions, implement features
**Need:** Trace requests, understand dependencies, debug production

### 🚀 Accelerators (Solution Implementers)  
**Do:** Deploy for governments, configure workflows, monitor production
**Need:** Health checks, diagnose configs, troubleshoot without code access

### 🔧 The Middle
DevOps, Architects, Support, QA - each needs different access levels

---

## Current Pain

**Contributors:**
- Tracing across 20+ services
- Complex local setups
- No production visibility

**Accelerators:**
- Black-box services
- No standard health checks
- Engineering dependency for issues

---

## MCP Solution

### Universal Tools
```
docs    → Service documentation
apis    → OpenAPI specs  
health  → Service status
trace   → Request flow
logs    → Debug information
```

### One Interface, Multiple Depths
- **Basic:** `health` - Is it working?
- **Debug:** `trace request_id` - Where did it fail?
- **Deep:** `tools_*` - Service-specific operations

---

## Real Examples

### For Contributors
```bash
# Debug your code changes instantly
mcp> trace request_id: "req-123"
→ See request flow through your services
→ No local setup needed
```

### For Accelerators
```bash
# Check deployment health
mcp> health service_name: "egov-user"
→ Instant status check
→ No SSH needed
```

### For Everyone
```bash
# Self-service debugging
mcp> logs service_name: "workflow" last_n: 100
→ Find issues quickly
→ No special access required
```

## The Vision

Transform DIGIT from **collection of services** to **observable platform**

✅ **Self-Documenting** - Services explain themselves
✅ **Self-Diagnosing** - Problems surface with context  
✅ **Self-Service** - Users solve their own issues
✅ **Standardized** - One way for all services
✅ **Scalable** - More users, not more engineers

## Impact

**Before MCP:**
- Setup local environment (2 days)
- Find the issue (hours)
- Get help from engineering (wait)

**With MCP:**
- Connect to service (seconds)
- Trace the issue (minutes)
- Fix it yourself (done)

---

## Bottom Line

**For Contributors:** Deep tools without setup overhead
**For Accelerators:** Operational visibility without complexity  
**For Everyone:** The right tool at the right abstraction

*MCP: Making DIGIT's complexity manageable for everyone.*
